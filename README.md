# BATTLESHIPS GAME Portfolio Project 3 - Python Essentials.

Things I've worked on since the last 

User Stories to achieve:

User Sories 

1. Make a board your own size with a Maximum of 8. 
2. Fire shots at the board & decide how they register.
3. Decide how the battleships are represented & randomise hits for each game. 
4. Make Battleships invisble for game.
5. Say if shot isn't on the board with a 'H' for hit or 'M' for miss.
6. Explain the Rules to the User. 
7. Make the flow of the game feel user friendly .
8. Loop the game X 10.

# Purpose of the project & description.
>>>>>>> 87fb1c317d72b475cf61e685ef71dc0c42442d17

The purpose of this project is to build an interactive brain game for a user to play against the computer.
The game is simple, and repeats in a loop of 10 tries then it restarts.
The grid size is chosen by the user. The maximum it's set to is a grid of 8, if a harder game was to be functioned it could go to 25 for example. 
The rules are explained at the beginning to give the user clear instruction. 
There's 3 battleships placed Invisibly on the board, the user then has 10 tries to hit the battleships with their missile which is represented by a H for hit 
& an M for Miss.
