What is  Battleships?...
An Interactive game created for the user to have a bit fun trying to find where the battleships are on the board, marked by an X with their "Shot" which they have endless chances to guess. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player in this case the user is playing against the computer. 

I've started off my game by having some simple interacation with the User 


 1. Are you ready to play Battleships?..
 2. If yes. Ask if they would like the rules explained?..
 3. If no..."Take their time & come back when ready" keeping it user friendly. 
 4. If they wish to go straight into it- go straight into the game. 




The big question of the game is...." Where do you want to shoot on the board?"...
THe board is default 10x10 column and rows.
But the user has a choice to what size they wish to display their board.

An example answer to the qeustions would looke like this- "1,1"/ "4,7"

a "*" represents a miss
a "X" represents a hit.



Overall Stucture 
1. User interaction

2. Make the board 

3. Get it into X & Y cordinates

4. Display a board with shots

5. Decided how to represent the battleships

6. Decide overall game state

7. Work out when a shot is a hit or a miss 

8. Game over loop
